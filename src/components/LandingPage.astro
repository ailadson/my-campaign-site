            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 sm:text-2xl">Who Am I...</h3>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I am a dedicated civil servant with a deep passion for justice and equity. I have lived in Olympia Fields for 4 years, and I truly love it here. Throughout my career, I have been committed to ensuring that the people in my community have access to the best resources and services. I make it a priority to understand the political environment in which I live and raise my family.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Not long after settling here, I became involved in several projects within the school district and my HOA. Motivated to make a larger impact, I decided to run for a seat on the Board of Directors and was overwhelmingly elected to serve for the longest term available.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Upon my election, I was nominated by the Board to serve as Treasurer. With a background in accounts receivable and as a former government manager, I was able to confidently tackle the responsibilities of the role. I continue to serve with integrity, always prioritizing the greater good of our community and ensuring that all decisions and actions taken by our board reflect our shared commitment to the well-being of Olympia Fields. I believe that those in leadership must be dedicated to putting the needs of our community first, working together with a sense of accountability and responsibility to create a stronger, more vibrant village for everyone.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
              As a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, I have led multiple social justice initiatives, particularly focused on empowering marginalized communities and advocating for systemic change. Having served on numerous committees including serving as chairwoman of Global Impact and Social Justice, I spearheaded fundraising campaigns that raised thousands of dollars for educational programs, healthcare initiatives, and resources for underprivileged families. One of the most impactful projects I led was a partnership with local organizations to provide essential supplies—such as food, shoes, and clothing—to underserved communities in Ghana.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Through this initiative, we not only alleviated immediate needs but also supported long-term development efforts, including scholarships for young girls to access education and medical supplies for rural health clinics. In addition to our global work, I've been involved in local advocacy campaigns that focus on racial and economic equity, striving to ensure that those who have been historically marginalized have a voice and the support needed to thrive.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              As a passionate advocate for social justice and a seasoned professional in governance and regulatory compliance, I bring a unique blend of experience and dedication to facilitating the change we need here in Olympia Fields.

            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              I see tremendous potential to revitalize our village, and I am eager to forge strong partnerships with neighboring communities to promote collaboration. I believe that every voice should be heard, and when we come together with shared skills and a passion for the success of our community, great things can happen. While I value friendship and bonds, I believe we must always prioritize the collective good of our community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              My vision includes increasing home values and attracting greater demand for living in Olympia Fields. Additionally, I am committed to revitalizing our local business infrastructure and organizing events that will generate both interest and revenue for our village.

            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Collaboration and community engagement are at the heart of my approach. As a woman of faith with a heart for family, I believe the best solutions come from open dialogue and collective problem-solving. I want to get to know you, and I'm committed to creating spaces where everyone feels heard and valued. Whether working with stakeholders, advocating for marginalized voices, or facilitating partnerships, I am deeply committed to building bridges and empowering individuals to take an active role in shaping the future of our community.
